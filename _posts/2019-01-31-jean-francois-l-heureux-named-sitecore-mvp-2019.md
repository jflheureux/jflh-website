Sitecore gives the MVP award to those who continuously share their knowledge of Sitecore products to assist the broader community. I’m very proud of the work I have done in the past year, including: Writing blog posts, presenting at SUGCON and Sitecore Symposium, helping others on Sitecore Slack and Sitecore Stack Exchange, organizing the Sitecore User Group Quebec, and contributing to open source modules. This year, I am one of 14 MVPs in Canada and one of 5 MVPs in Quebec.

The nice part is that it is not that much effort. It is passion. It makes me happy to share my knowledge. I learn a lot from this involvement. It is fun because the Sitecore community is welcoming, inclusive, vibrant, and shares everything.

A big thanks to the Sitecore community and the judges this year.

See you in London and Orlando in 2019!
