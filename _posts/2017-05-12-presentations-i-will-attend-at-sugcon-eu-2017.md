[Sitecore User Group Conference (SUGCON) Europe](http://www.sugcon.eu) starts in less than a week. The speaker lineup and the presentations are incredible. This is a very good opportunity to meet other community leaders and experienced Sitecore developers.

I'm very excited because it will be the first time I go to this edition. I have been to the North America one in 2015. I will also receive my Sitecore MVP award during the event.

To prepare for the event, I have pre-selected the presentations I will assist.

## May 18th

### 14:40

#### Sitecore Helix Practically - by Morten Lyhr

Sitecore Helix is a very effective way of building Sitecore solutions. I've already been introduced to it through the Sitecore Habitat demo project. I want to learn more about it. This presentation will cover advanced aspects of Helix with a focus on client-side, JavaScript and componentization. With my front-end developer background, I think I will like it.

### 15:55

#### Using Specflow to drive your test automation - by Nathanael Mann

Integration and acceptance tests for web projects are hard. This is something I need to become better at. I hope this presentation will give me the right tools to do it.

### 16:50

I hesitate between 2 presentation for this time slot. Both seem interesting. I will decide at the last minute.

#### Sitecore Helix Fast track - by Anders Laub

This talk will be about the Sitecore Helix basics and the available Yeoman generators. I've used the generators once to add some modules to the Sitecore Habitat project. I think I can learn a few things and ask a few questions during this presentation.

#### Conjunction – Towards a better way of working with search in Sitecore - by Søren Engel

As a search specialist, I like to see new innovative solutions. Conjunction is a very promising way of defining the search queries outside of the project code. I haven't had time to see it in action yet. This presentation would be my chance to see it and ask advanced questions to its author.

## May 19th

### 9:30

#### Use Roslyn to validate your Sitecore code and data - by Robin Hermanussen

Programmer tools like Resharper are invaluable. Robin's idea to create new tools for Sitecore with Roslyn is great. This presentation will give me ideas for new tools.

### 12:40

#### Tooling for helix - with docker focus - by Thomas Stern and Emil Klein

The Docker part of this presentation is what got my attention. I know it can be challenging to run ASP.Net in a Docker container. I want to see what those guys have done regarding that.

### 13:35

Here also I hesitate between those 2 presentations.

#### DevOps with Sitecore in the cloud - by Nick Hills

One of my current task is to build a demo site and deploy it. I don't have much experience in deployment and continuous integration. I hope to learn a lot in this presentation.

#### Sitecore and ReactJS - by Richard Seal

I have worked with Richard at the last Sitecore Hackathon and he seemed very knowledgeable in using front-end frameworks like Angular with Sitecore. His presentation about React is well timed as I will probably have to use it soon.

### 14:30

#### Sitecore MVC - A developers journey - by Christian James Hansen

I worked most of my career with ASP.Net Web Forms and I'm just beginning my ASP.Net MVC journey. This presentation will teach me a lot on the differences of Sitecore MVC.

## Meeting me

I'm going to SUGCON EU to learn new things but also to network with a maximum of people. Don't hesitate to say hello if you see a small Canadian guy wandering around. I'll be happy to exchange ideas with you.

See you next week!
