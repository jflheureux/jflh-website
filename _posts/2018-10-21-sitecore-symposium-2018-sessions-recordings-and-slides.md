## Development and IT

### [Helix and JavaScript Services (JSS)](https://www.jflh.ca/2018-10-13-helix-and-sitecore-javascript-services)
By Jean-François L'Heureux

JavaScript Services (JSS) is a completely new way of developing your digital experience on Sitecore. In this session, Sitecore Technology MVP Jeff L'Heureux will demonstrate how to apply the Sitecore Helix principles to the development of new sites using JSS to keep them and their project architectures clean, maintainable, and flexible.

### [Experience the development workflow of your dreams with modern JavaScript and Sitecore JSS](https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fapp.box.com%2Fv%2Fsym2018-jss-slides)
By Alex Shyba

### [Take your Sitecore project to the next level with Node.js](https://www.codealamodeblog.com/symposium2018/)
By Anastasiya Flynn

Many Sitecore developers still see JavaScript as just a client-side language that’s used to enhance the UI. This session will prove that JS belongs server-side as well, showing how to use Node.js to automate server-side processes. We will cover how to break up client-side JavaScript into component-level Helix-friendly modules that are testable and reusable, and then use gulp to compile them into a single CDN-ready aggregate file. This approach makes code easier to maintain, makes environments more stable, and reinforces Helix principles of simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility.

### [World's fastest fully automated continuous delivery pipeline for Sitecore on Azure – how Achmea optimized its development and deployment workflow](http://blog.baslijten.com/my-sitecore-symposium-session-worlds-fasted-delivery-pipeline-for-sitecore-on-azure/)
By Bas Lijten

Achmea is the largest insurance company in the Netherlands and their businesses have the need to deploy good quality code fast and often to Azure with zero downtime. With multiple Sitecore instances for numerous sites which are built and managed by various teams using shared code and shared infrastructure, this can get complicated. That’s why we have defined an approach on how components, modules, and sites should be built, deployed, and tested, while following Sitecore best practices and Helix guidelines.

We’ll explore tried-and-tested tools and methodologies designed for speed, automation, and continuous delivery (think VSTS and Azure). We’ll discuss the best ways to structure your dev squads to maximize collaboration and productivity (and when to go maverick). We’ll also share insights from a recent supersonic mission, which involved delivering a major Sitecore project for an Australian platform business, with only seven months to beat the complex integration and data migration bogeys on our tail and land successfully.

### [Omnichannel retail: Personal and contextual experiences!](https://youtu.be/UG9GCXt7WAA)
By Ishraq Al Fataftah

Technology trends have significantly disrupted the way commerce works. Customers expect a seamless and consistent experience across all channels of the retail process. Omnichannel retailing is providing a more powerful experience that is combining online services such as product pricing comparisons/reviews and in-store kiosks and NFC technology. In this session, we'll explore Sitecore Experience Commerce as an enterprise solution that delivers an integrated, omnichannel personalized experience throughout the customer lifecycle. By leveraging online and offline channels across a single commerce platform, Sitecore is providing the right tools to achieve a personalized customer experience that is relevant to the individual customer and consistent across all points of interaction.

### [Who watches the watchers?](https://theagilecoder.wordpress.com/sym2018/)
By Jason St-Cyr

We are all guardians of the digital spaces our audiences live in. We control what data is collected, how it is used, how it is stored, and potentially how it can be abused. With advancements in machine learning, personalization, and individualization, we are looking at a new world of improved customer experiences. How do we ensure this is done in an ethical way? How do we protect individual privacy? How do we avoid bias in our algorithms? We will explore these questions and others and empower the audience to take ownership of these issues.

### [Where machine learning meets social #ThinkYouKnowMe](https://www.slideshare.net/UnaVerhoeven/where-machine-learning-meets-social-thinkyouknowme)
By Una Verhoeven

Learn how a social network (Twitter) can be combined with machine learning (ML) and leveraged to enhance the user experience. During the presentation, we'll focus on building an online book store using Sitecore Experience Commerce, SXA, xConnect, Twitter API, IBM Personal Insights, IBM Watson, and PowerBI. Most impactfully, we'll see how companies can produce true business impact through user experience WITHOUT storing a user's personal data (gender, twitter name, location, tweets). Using ML techniques, the trained model will recommend products (in this case, books) for the user. We will explore how users based in the Netherlands may have similar interests and needs as users in the U.S.


## E-commerce Experience

### [How to create customer loyalty programs using Sitecore Experience Commerce and Email Experience Manager](https://www.konabos.com/blog/video-of-our-sitecore-symposium-2018-talk-how-to-create-customer-loyalty-programs-using-sitecore-experience-commerce-and-email-experience-manager/)
By Kamruz Jaman, Akshay Sura

Using Sitecore Experience Commerce (XC) and Sitecore Experience Manager (EXM), we've created a modern loyalty program for our restaurant brands that has helped to reduce churn, increase retention rates, and drive category sales online through marketing campaigns and marketing automation. In this session, we will show you how we implemented the solution and how our clients and their customers have reaped the benefits of loyalty programs.

### [Ten Sitecore 9 Form features to increase conversions](https://www.slideshare.net/JainaBaumgartner/ten-sitecore-9-form-features-to-increase-conversions)
By Jaina Baumgartner, Sai Yerramsetty

Forms are one of the most critical aspects of a website. They are the point of converting anonymous users to qualified leads, and eventually loyal customers. They are the beginning of a lifetime engagement. Yet, the average conversion rate on websites is 2.35%, with contact forms garnering less than 3% conversions. In this session, we will give you a conversion boost by reviewing what the top 10% of websites are doing differently. With the help of Hexagon, we will share real-world implementations of similar experiences using Sitecore 9 forms and review their benefits with supportive analytics. Expect to leave this session with a renewed vision for increasing leads and building lifelong customers on your website.
