## Development and IT

### [Helix and JavaScript Services (JSS)](https://www.jflh.ca/2018-10-13-helix-and-sitecore-javascript-services)
By Jean-François L'Heureux

JavaScript Services (JSS) is a completely new way of developing your digital experience on Sitecore. In this session, Sitecore Technology MVP Jeff L'Heureux will demonstrate how to apply the Sitecore Helix principles to the development of new sites using JSS to keep them and their project architectures clean, maintainable, and flexible.

### [Experience the development workflow of your dreams with modern JavaScript and Sitecore JSS](https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fapp.box.com%2Fv%2Fsym2018-jss-slides)
By Alex Shyba

In this session, you will learn how to go from a "hello world" app to a full-featured, blazing fast progressive web application in under 40 minutes; how to leverage the best tooling of the open source JavaScript ecosystem for your next Sitecore project; and finally, how to leverage content delivery networks to deliver an outstanding user experience for customers worldwide.

### [Take your Sitecore project to the next level with Node.js](https://www.codealamodeblog.com/symposium2018/)
By Anastasiya Flynn

Many Sitecore developers still see JavaScript as just a client-side language that’s used to enhance the UI. This session will prove that JS belongs server-side as well, showing how to use Node.js to automate server-side processes. We will cover how to break up client-side JavaScript into component-level Helix-friendly modules that are testable and reusable, and then use gulp to compile them into a single CDN-ready aggregate file. This approach makes code easier to maintain, makes environments more stable, and reinforces Helix principles of simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility.

### [World's fastest fully automated continuous delivery pipeline for Sitecore on Azure – how Achmea optimized its development and deployment workflow](http://blog.baslijten.com/my-sitecore-symposium-session-worlds-fasted-delivery-pipeline-for-sitecore-on-azure/)
By Bas Lijten

Achmea is the largest insurance company in the Netherlands and their businesses have the need to deploy good quality code fast and often to Azure with zero downtime. With multiple Sitecore instances for numerous sites which are built and managed by various teams using shared code and shared infrastructure, this can get complicated. That’s why we have defined an approach on how components, modules, and sites should be built, deployed, and tested, while following Sitecore best practices and Helix guidelines.

### [Deploy Sitecore with zero downtime](https://www.dropbox.com/s/20fjfjqh3dvdekv/DeploySitecoreWithZeroDowntime-BO221156.pptx?dl=0)
By Bill Cacy, Patrick Perone

From synchronizing content to redirecting incoming Internet traffic, we will perform a live demo of a blue-green deployment. As part of the demo, we will discuss the high-level strategy behind the deployment and dissect the steps performed in Octopus. We will discuss some of the assumptions and limitations of blue-green deployments and the business value for clients.

By Adam Simmonds

Your CMO is demanding exciting new digital customer experiences, so your CIO needs you to fly faster with Sitecore. How can you deliver new features in hours instead of weeks? In this session, we'll cover the best ways to accelerate your development efforts. We’ll explore tried-and-tested tools and methodologies designed for speed, automation, and continuous delivery (think VSTS and Azure). We’ll discuss the best ways to structure your dev squads to maximize collaboration and productivity (and when to go maverick). We’ll also share insights from a recent supersonic mission, which involved delivering a major Sitecore project for an Australian platform business, with only seven months to beat the complex integration and data migration bogeys on our tail and land successfully.

### [Measure, if you want to go faster](https://jermdavis.wordpress.com/2018/10/11/get-your-sitecore-simposium-slides/)

Join MVP and battle-hardened developer Jeremy Davis and learn from his experiences building sites that can survive the load spikes caused by peak-time TV advertising. You’ll learn about common developer tools that will help you easily spot and correct problems in your code as well as best practices you can use to make sure your launch is a party and not a crisis.

### [Omnichannel retail: Personal and contextual experiences!](https://youtu.be/UG9GCXt7WAA)
By Ishraq Al Fataftah

Technology trends have significantly disrupted the way commerce works. Customers expect a seamless and consistent experience across all channels of the retail process. Omnichannel retailing is providing a more powerful experience that is combining online services such as product pricing comparisons/reviews and in-store kiosks and NFC technology. In this session, we'll explore Sitecore Experience Commerce as an enterprise solution that delivers an integrated, omnichannel personalized experience throughout the customer lifecycle. By leveraging online and offline channels across a single commerce platform, Sitecore is providing the right tools to achieve a personalized customer experience that is relevant to the individual customer and consistent across all points of interaction.

### [Who watches the watchers?](https://theagilecoder.wordpress.com/sym2018/)
By Jason St-Cyr

We are all guardians of the digital spaces our audiences live in. We control what data is collected, how it is used, how it is stored, and potentially how it can be abused. With advancements in machine learning, personalization, and individualization, we are looking at a new world of improved customer experiences. How do we ensure this is done in an ethical way? How do we protect individual privacy? How do we avoid bias in our algorithms? We will explore these questions and others and empower the audience to take ownership of these issues.


## E-commerce Experience

By Kamruz Jaman, Akshay Sura

Using Sitecore Experience Commerce (XC) and Sitecore Experience Manager (EXM), we've created a modern loyalty program for our restaurant brands that has helped to reduce churn, increase retention rates, and drive category sales online through marketing campaigns and marketing automation.

## Marketing Strategy, Innovation, and Best Practices

### [Supercharge your author experience with machine learning](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/MarkStiles6/sitecore-symposium-2018-supercharge-your-author-experience-with-machine-learning)
By Mark Stiles

Content authors face an ever-growing list of new tools and responsibilities that come with a modern digital experience platform. There is mounting pressure for these unsung digital heroes to spend less time fumbling with menu options, assigning taxonomies, or struggling to find the right creative assets and more time identifying segments, setting goals, and personalizating content in an effort to engage consumers. In this session, Sitecore MVPs Mark Stiles and Dan Murphy will introduce practical ways to use machine learning to overcome tedious tasks, use your time more effectively, and focus on high-value work.

What if I told you, you could build a Sitecore site in a couple of days? What if I told you, 80% of your Sitecore site could be built by .NET developers with limited Sitecore experience? What if I told you that implementing Sitecore is easier than you think? Attend this session and see for yourself. Witness a simple implementation pattern that any developer can learn in days. We'll focus building components and how to eliminate complexity in the development cycle.
