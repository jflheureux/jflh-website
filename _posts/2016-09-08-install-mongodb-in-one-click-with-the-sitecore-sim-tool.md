1. Select the __Home__ tab
2. Click the __Bundled Tools__ ribbon button
3. Click the __Install MongoDB__ menu item

A command prompt automatically opens and closes. It installs MongoDB as a service using the [Sitecore support installer](https://bitbucket.org/sitecoresupport/mongodb-windowsservice-installer/) and starts it.
