I am very happy to introduce my latest project: Sitecore XM Cloud Extensions. A browser extension that improves Sitecore XM Cloud user experience.

<!-- more -->

I had the idea to build a browser extension since I first [connected my local XM Cloud instance to Sitecore XM Cloud Pages by setting a local storage value](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/developers/xm-cloud/connect-xm-cloud-pages-to-your-local-xm-cloud-instance.html). A few weekends ago, I built the extension using React, [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [Sitecore Blok](https://blok.sitecore.com/). Then, I submitted it to the Chrome Web Store.

Today, the extension has been approved on the Chrome Web Store and is available to install: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pkonhbljhhbhbdjkacgmafheaebijmjh/](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pkonhbljhhbhbdjkacgmafheaebijmjh/)

It is a work in progress with only one feature for the moment:

- Connecting XM Cloud Pages to your local XM Cloud instance.

In the future, I want to add other features that would help XM Cloud developers and users in their day to day tasks. Your suggestions are welcome.

You can check the project GitHub repository: [https://github.com/jflheureux/Sitecore-XM-Cloud-Extensions](https://github.com/jflheureux/Sitecore-XM-Cloud-Extensions)

I hope this extension will be useful to you.
