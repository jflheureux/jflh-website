<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am Jean-François L'Heureux, a 33 years old software developer. I've spent half of my life programming now, beginning when I was a teenager. I'm passionate about web programming. Mostly front-end but also back-end. Everyday, I try to learn more and become a better coder. Keeping this blog active is the first step to motivate me to read more on my favorite subjects and put what I learn into practice by writing code.
